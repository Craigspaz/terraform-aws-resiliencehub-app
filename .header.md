# AWS Resilience Hub Application 

[AWS Resilience Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/monitor-and-improve-your-application-resiliency-with-resilience-hub/) is a new AWS service designed to help you define, track, and manage the resilience of your applications. \
AWS Resilience Hub lets you define your RTO and RPO objectives for each of your applications. Then it assesses your application’s configuration to ensure it meets your requirements. It provides actionable recommendations and a resilience score to help you track your application’s resiliency progress over time. 
This Terraform module contains AWS Resilience Hub resources. 

The module will be s3 state-file backed, as it is currently mandatory by Resilience Hub to onboard new terraform-Application using s3 only.\
As a result, we must provide the module with `s3_state_file_url` where the actual resources are deployed.

The `app-components` variable is an object list composed of the following schema:
```
list(object({
    app_component_name = string
    app_component_type = string
    resources = list(object({
      resource_name            = string
      resource_type            = string
      resource_identifier      = string
      resource_identifier_type = string
      resource_region          = string
    }))
  }))
```

A single app-component is composed of:
- `app_component_name` - a unique name for each app-component   
- `app_component_type` - one of the supported app-component types, as listed in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/AppComponent.grouping.html 
- `resources` - the list of resources to that are assessed together

Please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/AppComponent.grouping.html for more details. 

A single resources is composed of:
- `resource_name` - a unique name for each resource
- `resource_type` - one of the supported resource types, as listed in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/AppComponent.grouping.html
- `resource_identifier` - either an ARN or identifier, depends on the actual resources (some AWS resources don't support ARN, refer to docs)
- `resource_identifier_type` - either `Native` or `Arn`, should correspond with `resource_identifier`
- `resource_region` - the AWS region where the resource is deployed
